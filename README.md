# what?
**zeq** is:
- still an infant
- short for ezequiel
- a performance sequencer, inspired by the way i use my octatrack
- 4 tracks of 1 - 16 steps each
- vertically oriented

# overview
The top 2 rows of the grid are the sequence display, representing the active steps in the currently active track
The third row's left siide is the track selector. Each of the 4 illuminated keys represents a track to show on the step display.
The third row's right side is the page selector. Each of the 4 illuminated keys represents a "page" of the sequence (steps 1-16, 17-32, 33-48, 49-64)
The left-middle block of keys is 4 vertical sliders. Each one selects a sample for the track directly above it.
The right-middle slider adjusts velocity.
The bottom row contains global and modifier keys. From left to right, they are:
- Shift: Gives each key on the grid different functionality. (table coming soon)
- Edit: Toggles edit mode, where you can live-play sample pads and edit the step sequence.
- Endpoint: While holding, press a step to set the sequence endpoint, where it will loop to the beginning.
- Randomize: Randomize active track's trigs.
- Clear: clear active track's trigs.
- Transport: play/pause.
